## Utilities

Some projects of mine are embeded in this config.

### Themes

I am using my [theme switcher](https://github.com/eiiko6/linux-theme-switcher) script that creates symlinks in **.config**. Thus some appearance configuration files located in **.config** are irrelevant or missing and are actually located in **.config/theme-switcher/themes/**.

### Wallpapers

Wallpapers and color schemes are managed by [palette](https://github.com/eiiko6/palette).

## Installation

**installer.sh** should install the dependencies and apply the configs on any base Arch installation.
