## My [hyprland](https://hyprland.org) dotfiles.

Made with [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io).

### Themes
These are multi-theme dotfiles.     
I am using a custom [theme switcher](https://github.com/eiiko6/linux-theme-switcher) script that creates symlinks in **.config**. Thus most appearance configuration files located in **.config** are irrelevant and actually located in **Themes**.

### Pywal
If you are looking for configguration files that use [pywal](https://github.com/eylles/pywal16), every theme in **Themes** that end with `-wal` use pywal colorschemes.

### Fish
My [fish config](./dot_config/private_fish/config.fish) contains the **palette** function which I use to generate my pywal themes.
