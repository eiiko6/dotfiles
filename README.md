Made with [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io).

### Themes

These are multi-theme dotfiles.
I am using my [theme switcher](https://github.com/eiiko6/linux-theme-switcher) script that creates symlinks in **.config**. Thus some appearance configuration files located in **.config** are irrelevant or missing and are actually located in **.config/theme-switcher/themes/**.

### Fish

My [fish config](./dot_config/private_fish/config.fish) contains many utility functions, and most of the scripting in this repo.

### Installation

**installer.sh** should install the dependencies and apply the configs on any base Arch installation.
